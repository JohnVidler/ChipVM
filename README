# ChipVM
A terrible(tm) chip emulator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JohnVidler/ChipVM.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JohnVidler/ChipVM)

Reads compiled assembly code and attempts to emulate the functions of various microcontrollers. This emulator only handles logic-level emulation between subcomponents (high,falling,low,rising) so cannot simulate any analog components.
